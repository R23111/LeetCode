# 6. Reverse Integer

Given a signed 32-bit integer `x`, return `x` with its digits reversed. If reversing 
`x` causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then return `0`.

**Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).**
