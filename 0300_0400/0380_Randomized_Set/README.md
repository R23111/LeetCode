# 380. Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)
(29/11 daily challenge)

Implement the `RandomizedSet` class:

- `RandomizedSet()` Initializes the `RandomizedSet` object.
- `bool insert(int val)` Inserts an item `val` into the set if not present. Returns `true` if the item was not present, `false` otherwise.
- `bool remove(int val)` Removes an item `val` from the set if present. Returns `true` if the item was present, `false` otherwise.
- `int getRandom()` Returns a random element from the current set of elements (it's guaranteed that at least one element exists when this method is called). Each element must have the **same probability** of being returned.

You must implement the functions of the class such that each function works in **average** O(1) time complexity.
